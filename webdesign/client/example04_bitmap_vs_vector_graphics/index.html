      <h1>CoderDojo (bitmap vs vector graphics)</h1>
   </div>
   
   <div id="content">
      <p>This example tries to explain the difference between bitmap and vector graphics/images.</p>
      <p>Before we start to have a look at the two formats we have to check how our display/screen works. To display something on your screen, your graphics card expects to get
         a bitmap. This map is a raster of rectangles each having its own color. This little rectangles are called pixels. The following image (fig1) shows such a bitmap of circle.</p>
      
      <center>      
         <img src="images/circle.jpg">
         <figcaption>fig1: bitmap of a circle</figcaption>
      </center>
      
      <h2>bitmaps</h2>
      
      <p>A bitmap graphic/image stores the data as a raster of pixels. File formats using bitmaps are for example: bmp, jpg, gif. Because every pixel gets stored, the resulting file
      can get big even if you changed only a few pixels. To avoid using more disc space than needed many file formats (e.g. jpg) support data compression to make the resulting files 
      smaller. Not every data compression works without losing quality! The higher the compression the higher the loss of quality of your image will be.</p>
      
      <h3>Advantages of bitmaps</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>no conversion needed to display it - its already a bitmap</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Disadvantages of bitmaps</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>the resulting files can get really big</li>
         <li>bad quality of the image when you zoom in</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>vector graphics</h2>
      
      <p>A vector graphic/image is a text file containing the description of the image that should get drawn. A commonly used file format for vector graphics is SVG (scalable vector graphic).
      The image (fig2) below shows a circle drawn as a SVG. Beside the circle you can see the SVG code that is necessary to produce the circle.</p>
      
      <table align="center">
         <tr>
            <td>
               <center>      
                  <img src="images/circle.svg">
               </center>
            </td>
            <td>
               <pre><code>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?&gt;
&lt;svg width="100px" height="100px" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
     &lt;circle cy="50px" cx="50px" r="45px" stroke-width="2px" stroke="black" fill="none"/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;               
               </code></pre>
            </td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td colspan="2">
               <figcaption>fig2: a circle as vector graphic and its code</figcaption>
            </td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      
      <h3>Advantages of SVGs</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>scaling without loss of quality</li>
         <li>The style of a SVG can be changed by using CSS (cascading style sheets)</li>
         <li>a SVG image can get created by a javascript on the fly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ideas for extensions:</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Create a copy of the SVG file of the cirle (images/circle.svg) and add addtional objects (e.g. rectangles, lines, ...). The available SVG elements are documented here:
            <ul>
               <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/" target="_blank">HTML Graphics</a></li>
               <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/SVG/Element" target="_blank">MDN web docs</a></li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li><a href="https://inkscape.org" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> is a free SVG editor. There is also a portable version available that does not require admin rights to install it. 
         Download it and use it to convert a bitmap to a SVG.</li>
      </ul>
