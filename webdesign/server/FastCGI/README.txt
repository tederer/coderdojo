Wikipedias description of FCGI
------------------------------

FastCGI is a binary protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server. 
FastCGI is a variation on the earlier Common Gateway Interface (CGI); FastCGI's main 
aim is to reduce the overhead associated with interfacing the web server and CGI programs, 
allowing a server to handle more web page requests per same amount of time. 

To try FastCGI the webserver NGINX (https://www.nginx.com) can be used.
